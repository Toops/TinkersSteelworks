        <text>-Foreword-
            To preserve the sacred art of steelwork, we have written this book in a special invisible ink which is
            activated on a factor of time. This will help ensure that the people of the age have reached a level of
            social and technological maturity, so that they may harmoniously benefit from the knowledge contained
            herein.

            The discovery of steel opens doors to a vast and brave new world of marvels inconceivable by the primitive
            cave dweller. Heed my words dear reader: attentive caution must exercised in its production.

        <text>Steelworking is an art and a hallmark of the master tinker. Be your intentions noble and hands deft!

            -Slags O'Molten
            Scribemaster of the Tinkers' Society

            Welcome to the world of steelwork. Within these pages you will be presented the secrets of processing metals
            and non-metal materials into refined substances with much more substantial traits over their mundane
            predecessors. Just remember: experimentation is key!

            The High Oven will be your threshold into this process. It is smaller than the Smeltery you are accustomed
            to, yet, both the method for its construction and general operation are very similar.

    <page type="text">
        <text>Here are a few tips working with the High Oven:

            * Like the Smeltery, the High Oven functions as a liquid tank. It is capable of melting metals and more.
            Unlike the Smeltery, it cannot contain multiple liquids or mix metals into alloys.

            * Mixing materials is key! As time goes on, you will become familiar with oxidizers, reducers, and
            purifiers. These are properties of materials which may lead to robust crystalline structures within your
            metalworking.

            * The High Oven can be as small as three blocks high, or as high as eight. For each layer between the top
            and bottom layers,

        <text>more space will be available to cook items within. Additionally, the taller the structure, the hotter it
            gets!

        <text>The High Oven is a multi-block structure. You will need a Smeltery and the following materials to get
            started.

        <text>To begin, lay a 3x3 bed of scorched bricks. Continue laying bricks in a similar fashion upward, but leave
            the center hollow. Cap it off with one additional 3x3 layer, just like the bottom. While there are no
            vertical limits to the size of your High Oven, it is pointless to build it beyond eight blocks in height.

            Place the Controller in the middle of any layer you desire. You may place drains anywhere within the
            structure.

        <text>The High Oven should only be fuelled with charcoal or other specialized purified fuels which do not create
            unwanted residue within the chamber. To begin burning the charcoal, flip the lever. The High Oven's internal
            temperature will gradually increase with time as long as fuel is burning. Otherwise, the internal
            temperature will rapidly decrease. To melt metals into liquid form, the High Oven's internal temperature
            must meet or exceed the melting point of the metal.

            The High Oven may be used to process any normal metal as the Smeltery. It cannot be used to create alloys in
            the traditional sense. Instead, raw component materials may be mixed into the metals as they melt to produce
            entirely different structural formations within the base metal.

    <page type="picture2">
        <text>Crystalline structures may be formed within your metals when compound agents are mixed into the metal,
            causing fascinating chemical reactions! These raw materials may or may not be entirely consumed on a basis
            of their dissipation property. In the coming pages, we will cover a few of these compound agents known as
            oxidizers, reducers, and purifiers.

            Oxidizers provide oxidation to the chemical compound.

            Reducers bond with oxidizers to create an entirely new chemical compound.

            Purifiers filter unwanted leftover materials.

        <text>Scorched ducts provide an easy way to route items directly into the High Oven by material type. To utilize
            these, one simply places the duct within the structure as they do with a scorched drain. Upon inspection of
            the duct, you will find space to place items within, and a means to change where those items are routed to
            through some very familiar iconography. Ducts will automatically pull items out of adjacent inventories,
            such as chests, and they will also suck items in from directly in front of them. To stop a duct completely,
            simply apply a redstone signal.

            You may also notice the last of its routing options may look unfamiliar. This option is for solid item
            output, just as a drain pours liquids. As always, don't fear the tinker!

        <text>-Chapter 2: Deep Tank
            "Molten metal. It is as beautiful as any natural river. Its glimmer sparks insight; its flow is the harmony
            of man's industrial opus."

        <text>Deep Tanks are a a handy way of storing large amounts of molten metals or other liquids. Like the High
            Oven and Smeltery before it, the Deep Tank is a multi-block structure, and like the Smeltery, it may contain
            multiple liquids. The similarities end there, however, as the Deep Tank does not mix metals into alloys or
            melt anything at all.

            Deep Tanks may be constructed in square or rectangle shapes, and its size may be scaled to fit the needs of
            the tinker, as long as it is hollow. It can be built as tall, as long and as wide as the heart desires. The
            smallest possible Deep Tank is 3x3x3. The overall size of the Deep Tank directly correlates to its capacity,
            naturally! Also, a more resistant glass might hold more fluid.

        <text>In this tutorial, we will assume the desired size is that of the Smeltery. To begin, lay a 3x3 bed of
            glass (clear glass, stained glass, or seared glass also work, excepting glass panels). Surround that with
            scorched bricks, drains, and ensure the Deep Tank Controller is placed in the center of any side of this
            rim.

            Also note that the Deep Tank Controller may be placed on either the top or bottom layers.
