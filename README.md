##Minetweaker support
TSteelworks comes with built-in minetweaker3 support, here is a list of available methods:

###High oven fuel
```zenscript
// Adds a valid High Oven fuel (ItemStack fuel, int burnTime, int heatRate)
mods.tsteelworks.highoven.addFuel(<minecraft:stone>, 20, 1000);
mods.tsteelworks.highoven.removeFuel(<minecraft:coal:1>);
```
###High oven meltables
```zenscript
// Makes an itemstack meltable in the high oven (ItemStack input, boolean isOre, FluidStack output, int meltTemp)
mods.tsteelworks.highoven.addMeltable(<minecraft:dirt>, true, <liquid:iron.molten> * 72, 1500);
mods.tsteelworks.highoven.removeMeltable(<minecraft:dirt>);
```
###Mixing agents
These are used in mixs (like redstone + gunpowder + sand [+ liquid iron] => liquid steel)
```zenscript
// agents are managed using oredict, you need to pass it as a string (we're weirdos)
// An agent can only be an oxidizer, a reducer or a purifier, not more than one at a time
mods.tsteelworks.mix.addOxidizer(String agent, int consumeChance)
mods.tsteelworks.mix.addReducer(String agent, int consumeChance)
mods.tsteelworks.mix.addPurifier(String agent, int consumeChance)

mods.tsteelworks.mix.removeAgent(String agent)
```
###Mix recipes
```zenscript
// agents used in here must be registered.
mods.tsteelworks.mix.addFluidMix(FluidStack input, String oxidizer, String reducer, String purifier, FluidStack output)
mods.tsteelworks.mix.addSolidMix(FluidStack input, String oxidizer, String reducer, String purifier, ItemStack output)
mods.tsteelworks.mix.addMix(FluidStack input, String oxidizer, String reducer, String purifier, FluidStack outputLiquid, ItemStack outputSolid)

mods.tsteelworks.mix.removeMix(FluidStack input, String oxidizer, String reducer, String purifier)
```

##Notice
Much of the code and structure of this project is heavily based on projects by [SlimeKnights](https://github.com/SlimeKnights).
Even this readme file is partially lifted from said projects.  ^_^
This project is meant to compliment their efforts.
